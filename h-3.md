## Hashes

# x) Read and summarize (with some bullet points)
•	One-way functions are vital in public-key cryptography, easy to compute but hard to reverse. They lack mathematical proof but play a crucial role. Trapdoor one-way functions, is explained by breaking a plate or disassembling a watch examples, allow reversal with secret information.
•	One-way hash functions serve as fingerprints, converting variable-length input to fixed-length output, and Message Authentication Codes enhance hash functions with secret keys for added security.
•	Hash cracking is a technique used by penetration testers to recover plain text passwords from their encrypted or hashed forms. Hashcat is a popular password cracker and designed to break even the most complex passwords representation. Rockyou is one of the biggest dictionary of passwords.
•	Hashcat needs to know the type of the hash to crack, the number for the -m parameter. It's common to look at hashes really hard and compare them to 'hashcat --example-hashes'.
•	In hashid, -m parameter shows the number that's used in the actual cracking, the hashcat parameter with the same name -m. md5, as it's a very common hash compared to md2 and md4
•	Command Line Basics Revisited article is a good place to refresh the basics of Linux commands in command line.

a)

String ‘Tero00’ will cause hash to start with zero.
In the case of Bitcoin, miners compete to find a nonce that, when combined with the block
data, results in a hash that meets certain criteria. The most well-known criteria is that the
resulting hash must have a certain number of leading zeros. This process is known as Proof
of Work (PoW). Miners iteratively adjust the nonce until they find a hash that satisfies the
required conditions.

For finding max leading zero values I shall use python script to help.

Testing target zeros = 5

b)

Even if only one letter has changed, the entire hash content is different.

The hash format appears to be a bcrypt hash. Bcrypt is a cryptographic hash function designed to be
slow and computationally intensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks. The format typically
includes information such as the algorithm identifier (e.g., &quot;$2y$&quot;), the cost and the actual hashed
password.
In your provided hash, the &quot;$2y$&quot; indicates the bcrypt algorithm, and &quot;18&quot; is the cost factor, which
determines the number of iterations used in the hashing process. The remainder of the string is the
actual hashed password.

Enabling GPU Acceleration:
Hashcat will automatically use GPU acceleration if it detects compatible GPUs. I can also specify the
device with the -d flag, e.g., -d 1 for the second GPU.
