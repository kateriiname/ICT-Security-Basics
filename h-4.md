## Protocol Building Blocks 2.5-2.8
- In most practical implementations public-key cryptography is used to secure and distribute session keys; those session keys are used with symmetric algorithms to secure message traffic [879]. This is sometimes called a hybrid cryptosystem.
- Encryption is easy with the public key, decryption requires the private key. It resolves key management issues in symmetric cryptosystems. Hybrid cryptosystems combine public-key cryptography for secure key distribution and symmetric algorithms for efficient encryption. Public-key cryptography's slow speed and vulnerability to chosen-plaintext attacks necessitate its use alongside symmetric algorithms.
- Merkle's technique was based on “puzzles” that were easier to solve for the sender and receiver than for an eavesdropper.
  
- Digital signatures are means of ensuring the authenticity, unforgeability, non-reusability, unalterability, and non-repudiation of digital documents.
- Digital signatures aim to replicate the characteristics of handwritten signatures in the digital realm, providing authenticity and integrity to digitally signed documents. Despite not being completely foolproof, they offer a level of security that aligns with the challenges of the digital environment.
- Trent's Role: The system relies on a trusted arbitrator (Trent), but the process can be time-consuming, and Trent becomes a bottleneck in the communication system. Creating and maintaining a universally trusted arbitrator pose practical challenges.
- Digital Signature Trees: Ralph Merkle proposed a scheme using secret-key cryptography and a tree structure to create numerous one-time signatures, aiming to enhance security and efficiency.
- Public-Key Cryptography: Public-key algorithms offer a more efficient and scalable approach. Alice signs a document with her private key, and Bob verifies it with her public key. This eliminates the need for a central arbitrator for each signature.
- To prevent misuse, timestamps are often added to digital signatures, ensuring that signed documents cannot be reused or repudiated by the signer.
- To address efficiency concerns, digital signature protocols often use one-way hash functions, signing the hash of a document instead of the entire document. This improves speed and reduces storage requirements.

- Combining digital signatures with public-key cryptography enhances security and authenticity.
- Different key pairs for encryption and signatures provide advantages, such as separate key management. Using different operations or algorithms for encryption and signatures, along with timestamps, can mitigate attacks
- Cryptographically secure pseudo-random sequences must be unpredictable, resisting attacks on their predictability. Real random sequences, with the additional property of being irreproducible, are challenging to achieve in the deterministic world of computers
