# x) Read and summarize
## Protocol Building Blocks 2.5-2.8
- In most practical implementations public-key cryptography is used to secure and distribute session keys; those session keys are used with symmetric algorithms to secure message traffic [879]. This is sometimes called a hybrid cryptosystem.
- Encryption is easy with the public key, decryption requires the private key. It resolves key management issues in symmetric cryptosystems. Hybrid cryptosystems combine public-key cryptography for secure key distribution and symmetric algorithms for efficient encryption. Public-key cryptography's slow speed and vulnerability to chosen-plaintext attacks necessitate its use alongside symmetric algorithms.
- Merkle's technique was based on “puzzles” that were easier to solve for the sender and receiver than for an eavesdropper.
  
- Digital signatures are means of ensuring the authenticity, unforgeability, non-reusability, unalterability, and non-repudiation of digital documents.
- Digital signatures aim to replicate the characteristics of handwritten signatures in the digital realm, providing authenticity and integrity to digitally signed documents. Despite not being completely foolproof, they offer a level of security that aligns with the challenges of the digital environment.
- Trent's Role: The system relies on a trusted arbitrator (Trent), but the process can be time-consuming, and Trent becomes a bottleneck in the communication system. Creating and maintaining a universally trusted arbitrator pose practical challenges.
- Digital Signature Trees: Ralph Merkle proposed a scheme using secret-key cryptography and a tree structure to create numerous one-time signatures, aiming to enhance security and efficiency.
- Public-Key Cryptography: Public-key algorithms offer a more efficient and scalable approach. Alice signs a document with her private key, and Bob verifies it with her public key. This eliminates the need for a central arbitrator for each signature.
- To prevent misuse, timestamps are often added to digital signatures, ensuring that signed documents cannot be reused or repudiated by the signer.
- To address efficiency concerns, digital signature protocols often use one-way hash functions, signing the hash of a document instead of the entire document. This improves speed and reduces storage requirements.

- Combining digital signatures with public-key cryptography enhances security and authenticity.
- Different key pairs for encryption and signatures provide advantages, such as separate key management. Using different operations or algorithms for encryption and signatures, along with timestamps, can mitigate attacks
- Cryptographically secure pseudo-random sequences must be unpredictable, resisting attacks on their predictability. The key is generally the seed used to set the initial state of the generator. Real random sequences, with the additional property of being irreproducible, are challenging to achieve in the deterministic world of computers. 

## Cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures
- Cryptographic hash functions can be used as an integrity check to detect changes in data. Bitcoin uses cryptographic hash functions a lot to verify that data hasn’t changed.
- Cryptographic hash functions provide the same basic properties:
   1. The same input will always produce the same hash.
   2. Slightly different inputs will produce very different hashes.
   3. The hash is always of the same fixed size. For SHA256, it’s 256 bits.
   4. Brute-force trial and error is the only known way to find an input that gives a certain hash.
- Digital signature steps: preparation, signing, verifying.
- Two ways to use the key pair: the public key can be used to encrypt messages that only the private key can decrypt, and the private key can encrypt messages that only the public key can decrypt.
- Security considerations:
  1. Online storage of a private key on network-connected devices risks exposure to security threats, while offline storage ensures security by requiring physical access to retrieve the key.
  2. Storing a private key in cleartext on a computer's hard drive allows easy copying, but encrypting it with a password adds a layer of protection, requiring both hard drive access and knowledge of the secret password for compromise.
  3. Storing the entire private key on one computer simplifies transactions but exposes it to single-point attacks, whereas splitting the key into parts on multiple computers significantly enhances security by requiring access to multiple devices for key retrieval.
-  A signature is an encrypted hash. Ex.: John encrypted the message’s hash with his private key. This encrypted hash is the signature. If Lisa decrypts the signature B with John’s public key C, the result should be a hash that equals the hash of the message A in the email.
- You have full responsibility for the security of your private keys.

# a) Pubkey today. Explain how you have used public key cryptography today or yesterday, outside of this homework.

Note: I have done a presentation on encryption in Social Media, which is why I will not repeat the findings from there here again.

Cryptography plays a vital role in our day-to-day interactions. It ensures secure communication, authentication, and data integrity across various scenarios like financial transactions, legal documents, and network communication.

1. Authentication/Digital Signatures:
   Public-key cryptography ensures the authenticity of messages. Digital signatures, like those in Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), use encryption for email and file security. Certificates and trusted directories help associate public keys with users. Failure to secure email communications poses an information security risk with potential financial consequences.
2. Time Stamping for legal documents:
   Time stamping certifies the existence or delivery time of electronic documents, enhancing proof. Blind signature schemes enable message receipt without revealing content. This is valuable for legal documents in the electronic era.
3. Electronic Money:
   Electronic money includes transactions with a net transfer of funds, with options for anonymous or identified spending. Encryption safeguards transaction data, digital signatures replace handwritten ones, and public-key encryption provides confidentiality.
4. Secure Network Communications:
   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provides data security in internet-based communications, supporting encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and optional client authentication. The use of HTTPS, a cryptographic protocol, is essential for securing communications over networks, and ensuring the protection of sensitive data in transit.
HTTPS is a fundamental security measure for any business with a website or mobile app.
5. Encrypting Company Devices:
   Full disk encryption is essential for protecting sensitive company data on laptops and tablets, especially in industries like finance and healthcare. The cost of a stolen, unencrypted laptop can be substantial, making encryption a critical preventive measure.
6. Protecting Sensitive Company Data:
   Internally, organizations should encrypt sensitive data, like intellectual property, with file-level encryption and proper access controls to limit access to privileged employees.
7. Encrypting Databases:
    Encryption of databases containing sensitive records is crucial for compliance with industry regulations and protecting customer identities. Cyber attacks on databases are common, making encryption a key defense mechanism.

This process involves using asymmetric encryption (RSA) to securely exchange the symmetric key, and then using the symmetric key (AES) to encrypt the actual message. Different parties use different keys at different stages:
Public/Private Keys:
The sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the symmetric key.
The recipient uses their private key to decrypt the symmetric key.
Symmetric Key:
The symmetric key is used to encrypt and decrypt the actual message.
Security Evaluation:

## Strengths:
OpenSSL is a widely used and well-established tool with a strong reputation.
The use of AES for symmetric encryption and RSA for asymmetric encryption is a standard and secure practice.
OpenSSL supports a variety of cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
Concerns:
Key Management: Securely managing and exchanging keys is crucial for the overall security of the system.
OpenSSL Vulnerabilities: As with any software, OpenSSL is not immune to vulnerabilities. It's essential to keep the tool updated to address potential security issues.
Always ensure that all both message sender and receiver are using the latest version of OpenSSL and following best practices for key management to enhance security. 

# d) Explain how PGP protects against Mallory and Eve
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) protects against both passive eavesdropping (Eve) and active tampering or malicious modification of messages (Mallory) through the use of encryption and digital signatures.

Encryption for Confidentiality (Protection against Eve):

When a user encrypts a message using PGP, it uses a combination of symmetric-key and asymmetric-key encryption. The symmetric-key is used for encrypting the bulk of the data, while the asymmetric-key is used for encrypting the symmetric key.
Eve, being a passive eavesdropper, would intercept the encrypted message but wouldn't be able to decrypt it without the private key, which only the intended recipient possesses.

Digital Signatures for Integrity (Protection against Mallory):

PGP uses digital signatures to ensure the integrity of the message. The sender signs the message with their private key, and the recipient can verify the signature using the sender's public key.
If Mallory attempts to tamper with the message during transmission, the digital signature won't match when the recipient tries to verify it, indicating that the message has been altered.
The --sign flag in PGP commands is used for signing a message, and the --verify flag is used for verifying the signature.
Key Trust and Web of Trust:

PGP relies on a decentralized web of trust. Users can sign each other's public keys to establish trust. If Alice has signed Bob's key, and Mallory tries to substitute a fake key for Bob's, Alice would be able to detect the forgery.
The --list-keys and --sign-key flags are used for managing key trust in PGP.
Key Fingerprints:

PGP uses key fingerprints, which are unique representations of a key, to ensure that the correct keys are being used. Users can verify key fingerprints through secure channels to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.
The --fingerprint flag in PGP can be used to display the fingerprint of a key.
By combining these features, PGP provides a robust mechanism to protect against both passive eavesdropping and active tampering, offering confidentiality and integrity in secure communications.
