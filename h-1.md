##Helsec
During the Helsec the presenter gave different examples of BEC Fraud cases. It was easily explained how people get caught on such type tricks. It is pretty clear that such things like CEO asking you to transfer the money could not be taken as a fraud in case of highly business at the working place. The example with Eve was so detailed and I must confess I could have finally understood how these scams can go through. The presenter fortunately also gave the tips how to prevent the cybercrimes at the working places. He name the following control actions: deploy technical controls, educate personnel, deploy robust processes with Financial teams, acquire corresponding insurance.

I my own experience, I haven’t ever faced any cybercrime at the working place. However, while doing my entrepreneurship activities I have become a target of phishing mails a lot. The most remarkable cases were attempts to claim the payment of certain bills. One of them was an urgent email, saying that if I do not pay the bill, out webpage would be blocked. Which, I must confess, created a strong stress in the first second. Luckily, I got such mail when our company was not active anymore and I realized a few minutes later that such thing was just not possible.

So, we can conclude by the criminal can use many methods, like sophisticated invoice fraud by email or other. The most vulnerable cases are the financial prosperous company with large personnel and with the lack of cybersecurity knowledge. 

## Gandalf
When I started to use Gandalf, I decided not to look to any clue and solve it by myself as much as I could. I don’t remember how I passed the first level; it was easy anyway. Then I asked to spell the password with dashes for security reasons, then I asked to write the password reversed and on the 4th level I asked Gandalf to spell each second letter, however after that he didn’t want to reveal the other letters. It seemed that AI learnt the lesson. So, after half an hour struggle, I decided to google the solution and how surprised I was to find out that to get to the fifth level I had to ask to write it backwards. Again! Does it mean Gandalf haven’t learnt the lesson? It was a bit disappointing. After getting the tips there was no fun anymore to play with Gandalf and I just continued reading the article to learn more about the topic and Caesar cipher.
