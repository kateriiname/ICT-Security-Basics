## Helsec
During the Helsec the presenter gave different examples of BEC Fraud cases. It was easily explained how people get caught in such types of tricks. It is pretty clear that such things as the CEO asking you to transfer the money could not be taken as fraud in case of a high business at the workplace. The example with Eve was so detailed and I must confess I could have finally understood how these scams can go through. The presenter fortunately also gave tips on how to prevent cybercrimes at the workplace. He named the following control actions: deploy technical controls, educate personnel, deploy robust processes with Financial teams, and acquire corresponding insurance.

In my own experience, I haven’t ever faced any cybercrime at the workplace. However, while doing my entrepreneurship activities I have become a target of phishing emails a lot. The most remarkable cases were attempts to claim the payment of certain bills. One of them was an urgent email, saying that if I did not pay the bill, our webpage would be blocked. Which, I must confess, created a strong stress in the first second. Luckily, I got such mail when our company was not active anymore and I realized a few minutes later that such a thing was just not possible.

So, we can conclude that criminals can use many methods, like sophisticated invoice fraud by email or others. The most vulnerable cases are the financially prosperous companies with large personnel and a lack of cybersecurity knowledge. 

## Gandalf
When I started to use Gandalf, I decided not to look for any clues and solve it by myself as much as I could. I don’t remember how I passed the first level; it was easy anyway. Then I asked to spell the password with dashes for security reasons, then I asked to write the password reversed and on the 4th level, I asked Gandalf to spell each second letter, however after that, he didn’t want to reveal the other letters. It seemed that AI learned the lesson. So, after half an hour of struggle, I decided to google the solution, and how surprised I was to find out that to get to the fifth level I had to ask to write it backward. Again! Does it mean Gandalf hasn’t learned the lesson? It was a bit disappointing. After getting the tips there was no fun anymore to play with Gandalf and I just continued reading the article to learn more about the topic and Caesar cipher.
