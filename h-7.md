## OCHKO123 - HOW THE FEDS CAUGHT RUSSIAN MEGA-CARDER ROMAN SELEZNEV

# The BlackHat conference (USA, 2017) outlines the prosecution's efforts in a computer crimes case involving Roman Seleznev, one of the world's largest traffickers of stolen credit cards. The case spans from 2005 to 2014 and involves a complex investigation. This conference became of interest due to such phenomenon as "Russian hackers" which I have heard about in recent years a lot and decided to explore more.

# How did it happen:

- Roman Seleznev, a major player in stolen credit card trafficking, operated with homes in Vladivostok, Moscow, and Bali, with political ties. His online history, marked by aliases NCUX, Track 2, and Tupac, spans from 2002, evolving from trading stolen identities to credit card hacking.

- The investigation started back in 2002 when he engaged in carding forums, evolving from trading stolen identity information to credit card hacking. The Secret Service Cyber Intelligence Section began tracking Seleznev in 2005.

- Roman Seleznev transitioned to new identities, "Track2" and "Bulba," gaining prominence as a trusted vendor on the Carter SU carding forum. Detectives traced Seleznev's activities through compromised systems, connecting him to a server in McLean, Virginia.

- Russia's policy of not extraditing its citizens posed a significant challenge, limiting options for bringing Seleznev to trial. Seleznev's capture in the Maldives in 2014 tightened tensions between the U.S. and Russian governments. The trial team, including the speaker, was blacklisted by the Russian government. Despite challenges in extradition due to Russia's policy, Seleznev was arrested in the Maldives, with the laptop containing 1.7 million credit card numbers.

#  Evidences:

- Forensic evidence, including compromised systems, email accounts, and the Hop One server, formed a robust case, highlighting Seleznev's hacking techniques and facilitating the identification of numerous victims. The laptop revealed Seleznev's tutorial sites, marketing materials, and evidence of past aliases.

- Seleznev's laptop, iPhone, passport, and travel documents were seized, providing critical evidence. Access to the laptop confirmed attribution details present throughout the investigation. Seleznev's choice of the password "OhChico123" for his hacking empire raised security concerns. The password's translation to "butthole" in Russian added a humorous aspect to the revelation.

- The laptop contained a staggering 1.7 million credit card numbers, significantly strengthening the case against Seleznev. Seleznev operated web pages instructing individuals on using stolen credit card numbers, revealing his role as an educator in the criminal space.

- Seleznev ran searches on the PACER system to find court documents related to his identity and past aliases. The discovery of these searches on his laptop further established his connection to criminal activities. Seleznev's laptop contained marketing materials promoting his tutorial site, where he provided step-by-step instructions on using stolen credit card information. Pacer searches indicated that Seleznev was not only looking for information related to his current identity but also tying it back to past aliases, like "Bulba."

# At the end:

The sentencing (27 years) highlighted the severity of the charges, the impact on victims, and the departure from the recommended life sentence. The session concluded with a final question about the tip that led to Seleznev's arrest, maintaining confidentiality.
