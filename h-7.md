## OCHKO123 - HOW THE FEDS CAUGHT RUSSIAN MEGA-CARDER ROMAN SELEZNEV

# The BlackHat conference (USA, 2017) outlines the prosecution's efforts in a computer crimes case involving Roman Seleznev, one of the world's largest traffickers of stolen credit cards. The case spans from 2005 to 2014 and involves a complex investigation. This conference became of interest due to such phenomenon as "Russian hackers" which I have heard about in recent years a lot and decided to explore more.

- Roman Seleznev, a major player in stolen credit card trafficking, operated with homes in Vladivostok, Moscow, and Bali, with political ties. His online history, marked by aliases NCUX, Track 2, and Tupac, spans from 2002, evolving from trading stolen identities to credit card hacking.

- The investigation started back in 2002 when he engaged in carding forums, evolving from trading stolen identity information to credit card hacking. The Secret Service Cyber Intelligence Section began tracking Seleznev in 2005. Despite multiple unsuccessful capture attempts between 2011 and 2014, political ties and challenges with the Russian government complicated the case. The trial team faced forensic challenges, and Seleznev's well-financed defense team added complexity.

- Seleznev retired as NCUX and established new identities, "Track2" and "Bulba," joining the carding forum Carter SU in 2009. The Secret Service recognized his significance when he earned the title of a trusted vendor.

- Detectives initiated an investigation into Track2 in 2010, discovering connections to a Russian IP address through intrusions at Schlotzsky's Deli in Idaho and the Broadway Grill in Seattle. A breakthrough discovery linked Seleznev to a server in McLean, Virginia. Seleznev's hacking infrastructure was uncovered, involving basic tools like port scanning and brute force password attacks. Seleznev used collection servers like Hop One, Ukraine, SH Mac, and Smouse.
  
- The Hop One server yielded substantial attribution evidence, including cached orders, travel reservations, and a ticket order with Seleznev's full passport number for a trip to Indonesia. The evidence facilitated quick identification of victims through IP addresses, enabling law enforcement to issue notifications promptly. The investigation drew upon evidence from other cases, such as the Eastern District of New York's Carter Planet case.

- Forensic evidence from compromised systems, including Schlotzsky's Deli and Broadway Grill, contributed to understanding Seleznev's hacking empire. Critical evidence from email accounts associated with Seleznev's infrastructure, like "Reuben sembei Lynch" and "bookscafe@yahoo.com," revealed personal connections. The Hop One server yielded substantial attribution evidence, including cached orders, travel reservations, and a ticket order with Seleznev's full passport number for a trip to Indonesia. The evidence facilitated quick victim identification through IP addresses.

- Russia's policy of not extraditing its citizens posed a significant challenge, limiting options for bringing Seleznev to trial. Seleznev's capture in the Maldives in 2014 tightened tensions between the U.S. and Russian governments. The trial team, including the speaker, was blacklisted by the Russian government. Despite challenges in extradition due to Russia's policy, Seleznev was arrested in the Maldives, with the laptop containing 1.7 million credit card numbers. The laptop revealed Seleznev's tutorial sites, marketing materials, and evidence of past aliases.
- Seleznev's laptop, iPhone, passport, and travel documents were seized, providing critical evidence. Access to the laptop confirmed attribution details present throughout the investigation. Seleznev's choice of the password "OhChico123" for his hacking empire raised security concerns. The password's translation to "butthole" in Russian added a humorous aspect to the revelation.
- The laptop contained a staggering 1.7 million credit card numbers, significantly strengthening the case against Seleznev.
- Seleznev operated web pages instructing individuals on using stolen credit card numbers, revealing his role as an educator in the criminal space.
Seleznev ran searches on the PACER system to find court documents related to his identity and past aliases.
The discovery of these searches on his laptop further established his connection to criminal activities.

Seleznev's laptop contained marketing materials promoting his tutorial site, where he provided step-by-step instructions on using stolen credit card information.
Pacer searches indicated that Seleznev was not only looking for information related to his current identity but also tying it back to past aliases, like "Bulba."


- The sentencing (27 years) highlighted the severity of charges, the impact on victims, and the departure from the recommended life sentence. The session concluded with a final question about the tip that led to Seleznev's arrest, maintaining confidentiality.
