Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
- The Tor Challenge gained over 1000 new Tor relays. Common misconceptions about Tor are debunked, including its effectiveness despite NSA leaks, diverse user base beyond criminals, absence of a military backdoor, no US prosecutions for running Tor relays, user-friendly interface, improved speed, and imperfections that require careful usage to maintain anonymity. Users are encouraged to contribute to the Tor network's speed and should be aware of potential pitfalls related to services like Google and Facebook when using Tor.
  
## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).
First, I downloaded the Tor browser from the link below.

I chose the version for Linux OS

Screenshot after extracting and unpacking files. I selected ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù with the default connection settings.

## b) Browse the TOR network, find, take screenshots, and comment on a search engine for the onion sites

- DuckDuckGo is a famous search engine with good privacy.

- TOR66 is a common link hub in the dark web so that is a good place to start surfing onion sites.

## Marketplace

In the Torbay marketplace, I can buy illegal goods and items

## Fraud.
If I order something from this website I might not get anything good.

## Forum.
Hidden Answers site dark web users can post and read articles. The funny detail is to use a dark theme color with black text.

## A well-known organization
Search result for a well-known organization ‚ÄúUnited Nations‚Äù. Among the first three search results, there was a link to hire an assassin. ü§Ø

The first link in the search was the CIA onion website.

## c) In your own words, how does anonymity work in TOR? (e.g. how does it use: public keys, encryption, what algorithms? This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)
Tor's core principle is "onion routing," a technique for anonymous communication on a public network. In Onion routing, messages are encapsulated in several encryption layers, which is analogous to the encapsulation of the OSI 7-layer model. It is called onion routing because onions have layers, and this network protocol also has layers.
The resulting "onion" (the fully encapsulated message) is then sent through the network's nodes (called onion routers), and each node peels back a layer of the "onion" to reveal the data's next destination. After the last layer is removed, you will get the original message text.
The original author remains anonymous because each node in the network is only aware of the nodes preceding and following the path (except the first node, which knows the sender but does not know the final destination).
The connections in the ToR network between the entry and exit nodes are encrypted using advanced encryption standard (AES). For establishing the connection, a system of asymmetric encryption is used, with public and private keys.

Tor‚Äôs Threat model ‚Äì Tor is a volunteer-based network: Tor relays are not trusted

Tor‚Äôs Threat model ‚Äì Tor is a volunteer-based network: Tor relays are not trusted
Reference: https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/nsdi17_slides_kim.pdf

There are many specifics, for example, attacks on the different approaches to propagating network information. Tor currently distributes information about all the nodes in the network to each client before it begins communicating using about a dozen directory authorities and a system of mirrors.
