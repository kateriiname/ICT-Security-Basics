## x) Read and summarize (briefly, e.g. with some bullets)
Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser ‚Ç¨; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR".
- The Tor browser, a modified version of Firefox, significantly enhances anonymous Internet use by concealing users' IP addresses, ensuring effective anonymity without technical complexities. Its simplicity and accessibility set it apart, making it a user-friendly option for anyone seeking anonymous Internet browsing.
- Tor enables unfettered and anonymous internet communication, providing access to blocked websites, facilitating whistleblowers' anonymous communication, and ensuring private conversations for businesses and individuals. Originally developed by the US government in 2002, Tor is now independent, open for improvements globally, and receives input from privacy-focused experts. Despite its positive uses, like any tool, Tor can be misused for criminal activities.
- The presence of Tor in electronic evidence raises concerns about overlooked and intentionally hidden evidence. Forensically examining devices with Tor installed, especially on Windows, Linux, and Mac, is crucial for uncovering Tor artifacts, as explored in the forensic analysis detailed later in this chapter.
- Tor operates by directing a user‚Äôs Internet traffic through random relays, employing layers of elliptic curve cryptography that, at present, is resistant to brute-force attacks. The encrypted data undergoes sequential decryption at entry, middle, and exit relays, allowing connection to the user‚Äôs desired target with an unencrypted link.
- Tor can be likened to mailing a letter anonymously by forwarding it through multiple individuals. In this analogy, Mary writes a letter to Johnny, conceals it in envelopes addressed to various recipients in different cities, and finally, drops it in a mailbox from her location in San Francisco.
- In this analogy, each envelope symbolizes a layer of encryption. Following the rule that each person can only unwrap the first envelope, the contents (encrypted) remain concealed in the innermost envelope. Bob in Denver (‚Äúentry‚Äù) and Barry (‚Äúmiddle‚Äù) participate in the process, each receiving the letter, removing the outer envelope, and forwarding it to the next recipient without viewing the contents. Susan (‚Äúexit‚Äù) receives the envelope, removes the outer layer, and forwards the letter to Johnny in Boston. At this stage, the contents become readable as the envelopes are discarded. However, Susan doesn‚Äôt know the letter‚Äôs origin in San Francisco. Johnny, upon receiving the letter, only knows it came from Seattle.
- Tracking criminals on Tor is challenging, with government agencies attempting to deanonymize users. Success stories are rare and often result from suspects‚Äô errors rather than breaking Tor itself. Investigators face limitations without access to federal resources, and Tor‚Äôs biggest weakness lies in user behavior, emphasizing the importance of not modifying browser settings. For instance, geolocation preferences and plugin usage can compromise anonymity. Despite ongoing research into Tor vulnerabilities, identifying users and decrypting data remains a complex task.
- Various theories suggest gaining control of entry and exit nodes or conducting man-in-the-middle attacks to compromise Tor security, but these methods demand significant resources and time. Nation-states might possess such capabilities, yet even they find compromising Tor challenging. Common criminals lack the necessary resources, and most methods rely on suspect errors.
- Obtaining a true IP address remains a primary goal in internet investigations, and capitalizing on a suspect‚Äôs mistakes, like seeding emails with tracking codes, is a potential strategy, albeit with associated risks.
- Embed tracking codes in emailed documents for less intrusive tracking, enabling IP acquisition when the document is opened outside the browser. Tor cautions on potential risks, advising safe practices like offline or virtual machine viewing. If these methods are impractical, consider identification outside the Tor network through open-source and online investigative methods, providing valuable insights for identification within the Dark Web.
- Corporate network investigations gain an advantage if Tor is used internally, allowing administrators to locate users. This approach is useful in tying suspects to threatening emails based on Tor network access and email receipt times.
- Cases are often resolved through mistakes made by suspects, and with Tor browser use, a suspect may unknowingly switch to a non-Tor browser, revealing their true IP address during emails or internet connections. This unintentional error can expose the suspect's identity to the victim, providing valuable breakthroughs in investigations.

Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
- The Tor Challenge gained over 1000 new Tor relays. Common misconceptions about Tor are debunked, including its effectiveness despite NSA leaks, diverse user base beyond criminals, absence of a military backdoor, no US prosecutions for running Tor relays, user-friendly interface, improved speed, and imperfections that require careful usage to maintain anonymity. Users are encouraged to contribute to the Tor network's speed and should be aware of potential pitfalls related to services like Google and Facebook when using Tor.
  
## a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).
First, I downloaded the Tor browser from the link below.

I chose the version for Linux OS

Screenshot after extracting and unpacking files. I selected ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù with the default connection settings.

## b) Browse the TOR network, find, take screenshots, and comment on a search engine for the onion sites

- DuckDuckGo is a famous search engine with good privacy.

- TOR66 is a common link hub in the dark web so that is a good place to start surfing onion sites.

## c) In your own words, how does anonymity work in TOR? (e.g. how does it use: public keys, encryption, what algorithms? This subtask does not require tests with a computer.)
Tor's core principle is "onion routing," a technique for anonymous communication on a public network. In Onion routing, messages are encapsulated in several encryption layers, which is analogous to the encapsulation of the OSI 7-layer model. It is called onion routing because onions have layers, and this network protocol also has layers.
The resulting "onion" (the fully encapsulated message) is then sent through the network's nodes (called onion routers), and each node peels back a layer of the "onion" to reveal the data's next destination. After the last layer is removed, you will get the original message text.
The original author remains anonymous because each node in the network is only aware of the nodes preceding and following the path (except the first node, which knows the sender but does not know the final destination).
The connections in the ToR network between the entry and exit nodes are encrypted using advanced encryption standard (AES). For establishing the connection, a system of asymmetric encryption is used, with public and private keys.

Tor‚Äôs Threat model ‚Äì Tor is a volunteer-based network: Tor relays are not trusted
![image](https://github.com/kateriiname/ICT-Security-Basics/assets/51989896/7d0911e5-8780-4d0d-b77e-55de5c4fbf21)

Tor‚Äôs Threat model ‚Äì Tor is a volunteer-based network: Tor relays are not trusted
Reference: https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/nsdi17_slides_kim.pdf

There are many specifics, for example, attacks on the different approaches to propagating network information. Tor currently distributes information about all the nodes in the network to each client before it begins communicating using about a dozen directory authorities and a system of mirrors.
