# Crown Jewels and Bad Guys

# x)Read and summarize.

## Summary:
The article by Hutchins et al. (2011) presents a novel approach to understanding and combating cyber threats through the Cyber Kill Chain model. This model, built on the principle of intelligence-driven defense, outlines seven stages that a cyber adversary must navigate to successfully execute an attack. 
One of the model's key strengths is its proactive approach to cybersecurity. By providing a detailed mapping of an attacker's journey, the model enables defenders to pre-empt attacks at any stage, thereby disrupting the adversary's plans and reducing the risk of successful breaches. It underscores the importance of intelligence and knowledge about adversaries, their tactics, techniques, and procedures, fostering a more active, anticipatory mindset among cybersecurity professionals.
The article underscores the need for continuous learning and adaptation in cybersecurity practice. This resonates with my perspective, as the dynamic nature of cyber threats necessitates an equally dynamic response. Cybersecurity strategies should be continually tested, updated, and improved to keep pace with evolving threats.

•	In their work, Hutchins et al. discuss the need for a more proactive and intelligence-driven approach to cybersecurity, introducing the concept of the Cyber Kill Chain model.
•	The model consists of seven phases: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives.
•	The Cyber Kill Chain model identifies the steps an adversary must take to succeed in a cyber-attack, thus providing defenders with a framework to disrupt these attacks at any step along the way.
•	Despite the evolution of cyber threats, the authors argue that defenders can achieve an advantage over attackers by leveraging knowledge about the adversaries and their tactics, techniques, and procedures in an intelligence feedback loop.

## Personal Thoughts and connection to my work:
Myself I have a little connection to cybersecurity and my interest in it is just a hobby. While the model is primarily used by cybersecurity professionals and organizations to enhance their defenses, it can also be of use to an average user like me in several ways:

1. Awareness: Understanding the Cyber Kill Chain model can make average users more aware of the various stages of a cyberattack. This awareness can help them recognize warning signs and take appropriate actions to protect their devices and data.
2. Prevention: By understanding the steps an attacker takes, users can take proactive measures to prevent or mitigate cyberattacks. For example:
   - Email awareness: Being cautious about suspicious emails and not clicking on malicious links or downloading attachments can disrupt the initial stages of the kill chain.
   - Regular updates: Keeping software, operating systems, and applications up to date helps prevent vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit in later stages.
3. Email and Phishing Defense: Many cyberattacks start with phishing emails. Knowing the techniques used in the initial stages of the kill chain can help users identify phishing attempts more effectively. This includes recognizing phishing emails that impersonate trusted entities and request sensitive information.
4. Password and Account Security: The Kill Chain model highlights that attackers often seek to gain unauthorized access to accounts. Users can strengthen their password security, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and monitor their accounts for suspicious activities to thwart these efforts.
5. Data Protection: Recognizing that attackers aim to exfiltrate data (the final stage of the kill chain) can motivate users to encrypt sensitive data, back up important files, and maintain a disaster recovery plan.
6. Incident Response: In the unfortunate event of a successful cyberattack, understanding the Cyber Kill Chain can assist users in responding effectively. They can report the incident, change compromised passwords, and take steps to prevent future attacks.
7. Secure Browsing and Download Practices: The Kill Chain emphasizes that downloading malicious software is a common attack vector. Users can take precautions by downloading software only from reputable sources and avoiding sketchy websites and downloads.
8. System Hygiene: Regularly scanning for malware, cleaning up unnecessary files, and employing security tools can help disrupt different stages of the kill chain. A well-maintained computer is less vulnerable to compromise.
9. Stay Informed: The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving. Staying informed about new threats and attack techniques, which are often discussed in the context of the Kill Chain, can help users adapt their security practices.
In summary, while the Cyber Kill Chain model is primarily a tool for cybersecurity professionals, its principles can be applied by average users to enhance their online security. Being aware of the various stages of an attack and adopting security best practices can help users protect their devices and data from a wide range of cyber threats.

# a) Make-belief boogie-man. Create a treath model for imaginary company.
Let's imagine a company, named "Leet electrons", a medium-sized enterprise specializing in bespoke technology solutions for the healthcare sector. Leet Electrons’s business requirements are to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their client data. The technical specialists ensure that the company's network infrastructure, software applications, and data storage systems are secure and reliable.

To create a threat model for Leet Electrons, we can follow the four-question model as outlined in the Threat Modeling Manifesto.


1. What are we working on? Leet Electrons's primary system would be their Client Management System (CMS), which handles sensitive customer data. It's a web-based application that interacts with a database to store and retrieve data. There's also an internal network where employees share resources and communicate.
2. What can go wrong? Potential threats include unauthorized access to the CMS (both from internal and external sources), data interception during transmission, malware attacks, and employee negligence leading to data leaks.
3. What are we going to do about it? To mitigate these threats, Leet Electrons could implement rigorous access control policies, use encrypted connections for data transmission, install robust anti-malware solutions, and conduct regular employee training on cybersecurity awareness.
4. Did we do a good enough job? This would involve regular audits and penetration testing to ensure the implemented security measures are working effectively.

The threat model diagram could include the CMS, its communication with the database, the internal network, potential threats, and the mitigations in place. Leet Electrons 's approach to threat modeling should be iterative, continually revisiting and updating the model as new threats emerge and the company's systems evolve.


Boogie-Man cheat guide: Typical hacking approach of simple Linux server target
Information gathering
nmap -sV <ip>
Typically a web server is found
Analyze webserver structure
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://<ip>
browse server with firefox or Google Chrome to found directories and also check robots.txt
If upload form is found, upload a reverse shell
If web applications installed, check exploitdb on web or use searchsploit
Check input fields with sqlmap, obtain cookies with Burp Suite if necessary. Dump database if SQLi found.
Use any found credentials to login using ssh  
If none work, do a vulnerability scan:
download nmap-vulners from git
nmap -sV --script nmap-vulners <ip>
Go to cvedetails.com and check all CVE:s with CVSS over 5.0.
Get exploit from exploitdb or use metasploit 
 
Once we have shell:
start a python web server in /opt/PEAS/linPEAS and wget linpeas.sh to the target
Check all suspicious SUID binaries and sudoable binaries for exploits available in gtfobins.github.io
obtain root and check important customer data and download it from hacked server.

Next we're searcghing for vulnerabilities using Metasploit framework and located many.
![image](https://github.com/kateriiname/ICT-Security-Basics/assets/51989896/d5c9e3f3-50b7-4cc6-8b1c-3625952d0517)

Next we prepare payload of remote code execution attack telegram and launch it. After launch reverse shell to target system is opened and we have gained remote access to webshop server. If needed privilege escalation, it can be made to access root level.

Recommendations
1.	Separate development projects/websites from production servers. If development code is required to be in a production environment, it should require a login before being accessible.
2.	Administrative functions requiring root-level privileges should require an account with root access. The use of normal accounts, especially those running the web server (i.e. www-data), with additional sudo privileges provides attackers with potential methods for privilege escalation.

## b) Incident analyses

Let's examine the infamous 2013 Target data breach using the Cyber Kill Chain framework developed by Hutchins et al. (2011). This incident resulted in the theft of 40 million credit and debit card details, along with the personal information of 70 million customers.
1. Reconnaissance: The attackers likely started by identifying Target as a potential victim because of its vast customer base and the valuable data it holds. They may have gathered information about the company's network architecture, security measures, and potential vulnerabilities.
2. Weaponization: The attackers created a malware called BlackPOS, a RAM scraping tool that can extract sensitive information from infected systems.
3. Delivery: The malware was delivered to Target's network via a phishing email sent to Fazio Mechanical, a third-party HVAC vendor that had remote access to Target's network for maintenance and invoicing purposes.
4. Exploitation: The attackers exploited the vendor's weak security measures, gaining access to Target's network.
5. Installation: BlackPOS malware was installed on Target's Point of Sale (PoS) systems, which handled customer transactions.
6. Command and Control (C2): The malware communicated with the attacker's remote server, sending the stolen data.
7. Actions on Objectives: The attackers achieved their objective, stealing vast amounts of customer credit and debit card data, which they later sold on the dark web.

## d) Voluntary bonus: What do you consider the fundamentals of security? What are the theoretical foundations you would teach on the first day?


The fundamentals of security involve understanding and practicing principles like confidentiality, integrity, and availability, often referred to as the CIA triad. Confidentiality ensures that data or information is accessible only to authorized users, thus preventing unauthorized access. Integrity involves maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire life cycle. Availability ensures that data or systems are available to authorized users when needed. These principles form the bedrock of any sound security policy.
In terms of theoretical foundations, I would teach threat modeling, which includes identifying potential threats, understanding them, and developing strategies to mitigate them. This process is crucial for proactive security and involves creating a structured representation of information that affects the security of an application. It helps in making informed decisions about application security risks.
Another key concept is data-flow diagrams, graphical representations of systems that specify interactions and context. These diagrams help in visualizing how data moves through a system, thereby identifying potential vulnerabilities.
Additionally, I would focus on understanding risk reduction strategies, such as implementing access control policies, using encryption, installing anti-malware solutions, and conducting cybersecurity training. Regular audits and penetration testing are also crucial to assess the effectiveness of these security measures.
Lastly, the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the face of emerging threats and system changes cannot be overstressed. This calls for an iterative approach to threat modeling, with regular updates to adapt to new circumstances.
