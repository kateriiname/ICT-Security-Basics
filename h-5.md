## Nakamoto 2008: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, chapters 1-6
- There is a need for an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof rather than trust, enabling direct transactions between parties without the necessity of a trusted third party, addressing the limitations of the current trust-based model, and proposing a solution to the double-spending problem through a secure peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server.
- The electronic coin system is based on digital signatures for transaction verification, addressing the challenge of double-spending by proposing public transaction announcements and consensus mechanisms among participants to establish a singular transaction history without the need for a central authority or mint.
- Note for myself: Minting is the process of creating or producing something. In the blockchain, minting means, validating information, creating a new block, and recording that information into the blockchain. For example, someone can mint an NFT or mint a new cryptocurrency.
- The solution involves a timestamp server creating a hash of a block of items, proving the data's existence at that time, and forming a chain by including the previous timestamp in each hash.
- A distributed timestamp server in a peer-to-peer network uses a proof-of-work system like Hashcash, ensuring the immutability of blocks through significant CPU effort.
- Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it.
- The first transaction in a block creates a new coin, incentivizing network support and facilitating initial coin distribution.

# a) Wallet. Create a BitCoin testnet wallet.


# b) Faucet. Get worthless fake money from a testnet Bitcoin faucet.

# c) Giveaway. Move money to another Bitcoin wallet. Choose an amount where the last two digits are 42.

# d) Explorer. Use a block explorer to analyze a block on the real Bitcoin blockchain. Explain what each value and field means. You only need to analyze the block information and one sample transaction, as a block can contain many transactions.

# e) Voluntary: Brainiac. Demonstrate how a hierarchical deterministic wallet can be regenerated from the bib39 phrase. You can rename the configuration folder to simulate a fresh start. In real life, you would keep the phare away from your computer, but for this simulation, you can copy-paste it instead of memorizing it.
